        <h1>Web3 vs Web2</h1>
        <p>
          Web3 and Web2 represent two different generations of the internet with
          distinct characteristics and philosophies. Web2, the current state of
          the web, is characterized by centralized services, limited user
          interactivity, and one-way information flow. It focuses on content
          consumption and is built around platforms like social media and
          e-commerce. On the other hand, Web3 represents a vision for a more
          decentralized, user-centric, and open web. It leverages technologies
          such as blockchain, decentralized networks, and smart contracts to
          enable peer-to-peer interactions, data ownership, and the development
          of decentralized applications (DApps). Web3 aims to empower users,
          promote privacy, and redefine trust in digital interactions. It
          emphasizes user control, security, and the ability to create and
          interact with decentralized systems. While Web2 is the current
          dominant model, Web3 holds the potential to revolutionize how we
          interact with the internet and reshape various industries.
