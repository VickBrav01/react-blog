        <h1>C++ vs C#</h1>
        <p>
          C++ and C# are both powerful programming languages, but they have
          different origins, uses, and features. C++ is a low-level language
          known for its performance, flexibility, and direct hardware access. It
          is commonly used for system programming, game development, and other
          performance-critical applications. C++ offers manual memory management
          and supports features like pointers, which provide fine-grained
          control but also require careful handling. On the other hand, C# is a
          high-level language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET
          framework and offers a more modern, managed code environment. C# is
          widely used for Windows application development, web development, and
          game development using platforms like Unity. It provides automatic
          memory management through garbage collection and includes features
          like extensive libraries, support for object-oriented programming, and
          a strong emphasis on developer productivity. Choosing between C++ and
          C# depends on the specific project requirements, performance needs,
          and personal preferences. C++ is ideal for performance-critical and
          low-level applications, while C# provides a more productive and
          managed environment for a wide range of applications.
