        <h1>React vs Angular</h1>
        <p>
          React and Angular are both powerful frameworks for building web
          applications, but they have different approaches and philosophies.
          React is a JavaScript library that focuses on the view layer,
          providing a lightweight and flexible solution for creating UI
          components. It emphasizes simplicity, reusability, and a virtual DOM
          approach for efficient rendering. In contrast, Angular is a
          comprehensive framework that offers a complete solution for building
          large-scale applications. It utilizes TypeScript, provides a
          full-featured set of tools, and follows a more opinionated
          architecture with features like dependency injection and two-way data
          binding. Choosing between React and Angular depends on the specific
          project requirements, team expertise, and development preferences.
          React offers more flexibility and is suitable for smaller to
          medium-sized projects, while Angular is better suited for large-scale
          applications that require a structured and opinionated framework.
