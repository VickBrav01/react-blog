        <h1>JavaScript vs Ruby</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Ruby are both popular programming languages, but they
          have distinct characteristics and use cases. JavaScript is a versatile
          language that runs in web browsers and on servers. It is primarily
          used for front-end development, allowing you to create interactive and
          dynamic web pages. JavaScripts strength lies in its wide adoption,
          vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, and its ability to handle
          asynchronous programming with features like Promises and async/await.
          On the other hand, Ruby is a general-purpose language known for its
          simplicity and developer-friendly syntax. Ruby prioritizes readability
          and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for beginners and for
          rapid application development. Ruby focus on convention over
          configuration and its elegant and expressive code contribute to its
          popularity among web developers. Ruby on Rails, a web framework built
          with Ruby, is widely used for building robust and scalable web
          applications. Choosing between JavaScript and Ruby depends on the
          project requirements, the development teams expertise, and personal
          preferences. JavaScript is ideal for web development, especially on
          the front end, while Ruby excels in building web applications with its
          focus on developer productivity and elegant syntax.
